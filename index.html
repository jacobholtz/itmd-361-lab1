  <h1>Quick Introduction</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is Jacob Holtz. I'm a third year student at IIT working towards a bachelors in information technology and management as well as a masters in cyber forensics and security. I wish to work in the IT field by this summer, and hopefully end up working as a security auditor later down the line.</p>
  <p>I have been interested in IT from a young age, where I started out tinkering with CMD in windows and attempting to teach myself HTML and CSS, so I have some web development experience. Over the years I skimmed across the surface of many programming languages including Java, C, C#, C++, Python, JavaScript and PHP but never really mastered any of them. I also like to go on websites such as HackTheBox vulnhub to try to compromise vulnerable machines to hone my skills, but unfortunately my attention span wears thin so I'm never really consistent with it.<p>
  <p>I think taking this class will teach me to not give up so easily when it comes to learning or relearning content, a skill that I can apply to my other classes and hobbies.</p>
